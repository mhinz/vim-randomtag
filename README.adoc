=== What is this madness?

Learn something new about Vim every day by jumping to random tags from help files!

=== Amazing! How do I use it?

Easy-peasy! Just run `:Random` for built-in tags. `:Random!` also parses the `runtimepath` and includes tags from external plugins.

=== Typical workflow

```vim
:Random!
@:
@@
@@
@@
```

You get the idea.

=== Author and Feedback

If you like my plugins, please star them on Github. It's a great way of getting
feedback. Same goes for issues reports or feature requests.
